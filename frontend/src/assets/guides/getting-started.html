    <h1>Getting Started</h1>

    <h2>Purpose of the Project</h2>
    <p>
        The <code>pan-os-upgrade</code> CLI tool is designed to streamline and
        simplify the process of upgrading Palo Alto Networks firewalls. This
        tool offers two distinct workflows to cater to different user
        preferences and environments: a Python-based workflow and a Docker-based
        workflow.
    </p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
        Upgrading firewalls can be intricate and tedious, posing numerous
        challenges. The <code>pan-os-upgrade</code> tool addresses these by:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Performing a series of readiness checks.</li>
        <li>Taking snapshots of the current network state.</li>
        <li>
            Creating backups of the configuration before initiating the upgrade
            process.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Two Distinct Workflows</h2>

    <h3>Python Workflow</h3>
    <p>
        This workflow is ideal for those who prefer working within a Python
        environment. It involves setting up a Python virtual environment,
        installing dependencies, and executing the tool via command-line
        interface.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Advantages</strong>: Offers more control and flexibility,
            especially for users familiar with Python.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Details</strong>: See the
            <a href="python/getting-started.md"
                >Python Workflow Getting Started Guide</a
            >
            for detailed instructions on setup and usage.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Docker Workflow</h3>
    <p>
        The Docker workflow simplifies the setup by encapsulating the tool and
        its dependencies within a Docker container. It's suitable for users
        seeking an easy-to-deploy solution without configuring a Python
        environment.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Advantages</strong>: Ensures consistent runtime environment,
            simplifies deployment, and is ideal for users not familiar with
            Python.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Details</strong>: Refer to the
            <a href="docker/getting-started.md"
                >Docker Workflow Getting Started Guide</a
            >
            for comprehensive steps on using the Docker container.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <p>
        <code>pan-os-upgrade</code> is equipped with several features for
        efficient and reliable upgrades:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Automation of Routine Tasks</strong>: Reduces manual errors
            and saves time by automating upgrades, configurations, and system
            checks.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Support for Direct and Proxy Connections</strong>: Connect
            directly to firewalls or through a Panorama appliance.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Active/Passive High Availability (HA) Workflow</strong>:
            Fully supports upgrading devices in active/passive HA
            configurations, ensuring both members are properly upgraded and
            synchronized.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Multi-threading for Efficiency</strong>: Utilizes
            multi-threading to parallelize upgrades, especially beneficial when
            upgrading multiple devices through Panorama, enhancing performance
            and reducing overall upgrade time.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Customizable and Extensible</strong>: Scripts can be
            tailored to fit diverse network environments and requirements,
            offering flexibility for various deployment scenarios.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Comprehensive PAN-OS Interactions</strong>: Facilitates
            extensive interactions with Palo Alto Networks appliances for
            operations like readiness checks, state snapshots, and report
            generation.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Interactive Menu for Firewall Selection</strong>: Introduces
            an interactive menu for selecting specific firewalls to target for
            upgrade, streamlining the process of identifying and confirming
            devices for upgrade within a Panorama-managed environment.
        </li>
    </ul>
