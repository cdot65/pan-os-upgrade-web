ChatGPT v4 works best when explicit instructions are given in plain spoken English. Usually the more words used to describe your desired outcome, the higher accuracy in the response.

With that said, please understand that the response will very likely have at least one error. It is up to you to review the response and make any necessary corrections. This is a limitation of the technology, and is not a bug in Saute but rather a growth period for ChatGPT and its v4 engine.

Examples:

(Ansible)
"Create an Ansible playbook that configures the network interface ethernet1/1 of a PAN-OS firewall, setting its IP address to 1.1.1.1/32"
"Create an Ansible playbook that retrieves the current version of PAN-OS running on a firewall."

(Python)
"Create a Python script that configures the network interface ethernet1/1 of a PAN-OS firewall, setting its IP address to 1.1.1.1/32"
"Create a Python script that retrieves the current version of PAN-OS running on a firewall."

(Terraform)
"Create a Terraform configuration file that configures the network interface ethernet1/1 of a PAN-OS firewall, setting its IP address to 1.1.1.1/32"
